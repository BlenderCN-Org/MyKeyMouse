### Description
  
Add '*view selection*' and '*view all*' shortcuts on mouse.
  
Keymapp a list of shortcut for almost all editor where:
- *mouse button 4* (often used as 'previous' action) is used to focus on selected items. (like *numpad period* button)
- *mouse button 5* (often used as 'next' action) is used to fit all elements in view. (like *home* button)
  
It does NOT affect any original shortcut on keyboard.

Usual location of button 4 and 5 on a mouse with basic extra buttons (this may vary a lot on different device)

### Why ?
The location of *home* key and *numpad period* is far from both hands and force you to quit temporarily your rest positions, tending to break the fluidity of the workflow.
 

### Addon preferences

In the addons preferences you can choose to:
- Invert the buttons
- In 3D view : Recenter the view on mouse cursor (like "Alt+F") instead of focus on selection  
- In 3D view : Toggle isolate (*numpad slash* button) instead of view all

### updates 0.0.3 (14/04/2018):
- By default shortcuts are now completely consistent (view_selected and view all everywhere)
- added addon preferences to invert buttons and customize shortcut in 3D view.
